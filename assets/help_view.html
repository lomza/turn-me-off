<h2>What this app is for?</h2>
<p>
    Turn Me Off app was written with testing purposes for Android testers and programmers.
    With this app you can easily schedule time for turning WiFi or Mobile data ON/OFF while your
    app loads something, in order to see if it properly handles internet disconnects.
</p>

<h2>Why would I need that?</h2>
<p>
    For instance, you have a questionnaire in your app or just a long register form,
    and you have one web service call to send all that data. In this case you want to make sure
    that everything was either sent or aborted correctly, even if internet connection was interrupted.
    Of course, you can quickly switch to Settings and turn internet off and then return to your app, but
    sometimes it's not enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another example would be the syncing of information. If, for example, 60% was synced and the connection suddenly
    broke, it won't be correct to roll everything back and start over, but instead to proceed from the same point it was
    stopped.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With Turn Me Off app you can easily schedule time for Wifi or Mobile data on/off connects or disconnects and stay in your
    app while those events fire. You can also combine WiFi and Mobile data turn on with some delay and see what happens.
    There can be many scenarios to test, but important thing is - you can test many of them using this app.
</p>
